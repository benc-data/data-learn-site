# opportunityData

This hybrid project model is designed to teach basic data science skills from the ground up. It doesn't matter who you are or where you've come from -- starting now, you can build the life you want with the right mentorship.

You should expect from opportunityData mentors:

- practical advice
- humble spirit
- lots of questions

opportunityData mentors expect from you:

- curious mind
- humble spirit
- lots of questions

This program is project-based, which means you'll be spending late nights beating your head against the wall, creating problems, debugging, and figuring out your way through (what feels like) impossible technical challenges.

_Your intelligence won't get you through it -- your character will._

- First, you'll learn the basics of programming.
- Then we'll move into the world of databases.
- Next will be extracting and wrangling data.
- After that comes some basic data science.
- Finally, the student will become the teacher.

There's no specific timeframe to complete the mentorship. In fact, we believe it never truly ends. However, we'll categorize everything into episodes, much like a television series, because why not? Take your time, go at your own pace, and discuss it all with your mentor.

When the time is right, look back and find someone else who could use an opportunity.
